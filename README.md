## Description

Museum Guide was built with a MERN stack and is an application that allows users to browse, view, and add objects to custom collections from the more than 470,000 artworks in The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection.

- Most museums display only 2-4% of their entire collections at one time. 

- Many people visiting them have no idea of the vast collections stored in vaults throughout the building and warehouses across the world.

Museum Guide takes advantage of The Metropolitan Museum of Artâ€™s [Open Access Program](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access) to allow users to browse the more than 470,000 artworks in its collection.

## Installation

```

```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```
